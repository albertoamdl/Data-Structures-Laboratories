Welcome to my Data Structures Folder! 

Here you will find all of the labs I have previously done in this class.

Lab 1-
I was asked to analyze 100 records containing usernames, salt values, and hashed passwords. My task was to create a python     program that would read the txt file containing the data, analyze and compare each hashed password with the correct one. All methods had to be done recursivly.

Lab 2- 
Task was to concatenate two data files that contain at least 4k each and abide a set of instructions. Every time you read a password from the file, check (using a loop) if that password has already been added to the linked list. That is, you need to traverse the linked list to see if that password has been added already. If the password is already in your linked list, update the number of times the password has been seen in the file. Otherwise, add a the password to the linked list.

Lab 3- 
Write another function called count_anagrams that does not produce output, but returns the number of anagrams that a given word has. The method uses a data structure called engish_words to determine if a given anagram is a valid word in the English language. You can think of engish_words as a container of all the words in the English language. We will implement this data structure using a binary search tree. To populate engish_words, we will use a text file called words.txt that contains 354,984 English words. You can download words.txt from the following URL: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/. 

Lab 4- 
Write another function called count_anagrams that does not produce output, but returns the number of anagrams that a given word has. But, this lab is done with a Red-Black tree

Lab 5-  
I was given the task to create a data structure called Least Recently Used LRU cache. The data structure can be made using a doubly-linked list and should run in O(1) time. The data structure should support the following operations:

-	get(key) - Gets the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
-	put(key, value) - Insert or replace the value if the given key is not already in the cache. When the cache reaches its maximum capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item
-	size() – Returns the number of key/value pairs currently stored in the cache
-	max_capacity() – Returns the maximum capacity of the cache


Lab 6-  
I was given the task to Implement the following graph algorithms:
●	Kruskal’s algorithm
●	Topological sort
I used the professor’s implementation of the Disjoint Set Forest and Graph data structures. Do at least one of the following to test your implementations


Lab 7- 
Joint to lab 6, I was given the task to Implement the following dynamic-programming algorithm:
●	Edit Distance
I used the professor’s implementation of the Disjoint Set Forest and Graph data structures. Do at least one of the following to test your implementations
